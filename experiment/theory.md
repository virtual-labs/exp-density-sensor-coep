## Density Sensor
### Introduction:

Density is one of the characteristic physical properties of a substance, which can be used to understand other physical and chemical properties.A liquid density measurement sensor with the tuning fork as the sensitive component, which is 
based on the resonance principle, is described in this paper and developed to measure density of liquids, static or in motion. It can measure liquid density directly, being a quasi-digital sensor, which not only has simple structure, small size, light weight, but also has high precision and reliability. According to the dynamic principle, an approximate parameters model of the tuning fork is established, and the impact of structural parameters, temperature and liquid on the natural frequency of the tuning fork are also analyzed either theoretically or by simulation, along with experimental results that showed the better performance of the sensor to measure liquid density.

### Theory Analysis and Simulation
#### Working Principle
The sensitive component of resonant sensor must vibrate at its natural frequency stably during operation. Discussing the infinitesimal element of sensitive component, it can be regarded as a single freedom system theoretically. The natural frequency of the system relates to the equivalent mass and the equivalent stiffness only. The tuning fork liquid density measurement sensor places the tuning fork driven by electromagnetic or piezoelectric method in the measuring chamber, and then the actuator transmits alternating force to the tuning fork to make it vibrate in accordance with its natural frequency. When the tuning fork contacts with the liquid measured, the added mass of the tuning fork changes, and results in vibration 
frequency (vibration cycle) changes. The detector picks up the vibration signal to detect the vibration frequency. By measuring the changes of the natural frequency or vibration cycle, the density of the liquid tested can be determined. Therefore, it is very important to obtain the natural frequency of the tuning fork exactly to ensure the excellent performance of the sensor.
The sensor is composed of the sensitive unit and the closed-loop control unit, where the sensitive unit consists of the actuator, the resonant tuning fork and the detector. Resonant tuning fork senses the liquid density directly, and the detector sends the signal which carries measurement information forward to the closed-loop control unit for processing and output density value, while the closed-loop 
control unit output excitation signal to control the actuator and then drive the tuning fork. The basic configuration of the sensor is shown in Figure.

#### Resonant Frequency of the Tuning Fork 
As can be seen from the analysis above, the natural frequency of the tuning fork has important impact on the performance of the sensor. In this part of the paper, an approximate parameters model of the tuning fork is established, and the impact of liquid density, position of the tuning fork, temperature and structural parameters on the natural frequency of the tuning fork are also analyzed both theoretically and by simulation. 
#### Resonant Frequency in the Ideal Condition 
The vibration of a tuning fork can be equivalent to the vibration of a cantilever beam. The vibration frequency can be obtained from calculating Euler Equation and described as follows:

where ρ is mass per unit volume, A is cross sectional area, l is the length, EJ is bending rigidity of the cross section, and βl can be calculated from the equation

Equation (1) shows that the vibration frequency of the cantilever beam relates to the cross-sectional area and the length.

#### Resonant Frequency Dependence on Liquid 
Through the study on vibration of free-free beams under liquid [10], it is assumed that the liquid is ideal, incompressible and without spin, and based on the Laplace equation:

we can get the liquid velocity potential function (x,z,t), and the changes of vibration frequency of a cantilever beam when the depth of the beam in the liquid changes. On this basis, we also have introduced the change of the first-order vibration frequency of the tuning fork when the depth in the liquid changes or the liquid density changes, as given by Equation (3) below:
